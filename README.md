# DevFolio

DevFolio is a modern, responsive personal portfolio website template. It is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and services as a developer, designer. The template features a clean layout, smooth scrolling, and interactive sections to help you present my professional profile effectively.

> **This project is an educational copy of the [DevFolio demo](https://routeegy.github.io/Devfolio/). All styles and layout are based on that source.**

## About the Website

DevFolio includes the following sections:

- **Home:** Eye-catching hero section with animated typing effect to introduce yourself.
- **About:** Personal information, skills with progress bars, and a brief biography.
- **Services:** Highlights the services you offer with icons and descriptions.
- **Portfolio:** Displays your recent work or projects in a grid layout.
- **Statistics:** Showcases key achievements and experience with counters.
- **Testimonials:** Carousel for client or colleague feedback.
- **Contact:** (Placeholder) Section for contact information or a contact form.

The template uses Bootstrap for layout and responsiveness, Bootstrap Icons for visual elements, and Typed.js for the animated typing effect in the hero section.
